        <h1>Gluten-Free Diet</h1>
        <h2>A Beginner's Guide with Meal Plan</h2>
        The protein gluten is found in items like wheat products, beer, and pasta. It may cause digestive symptoms in some people, including those with celiac disease.

A gluten-free diet involves excluding foods that contain the protein gluten like wheat and rye products.

Most studies on gluten-free diets have involved people with celiac disease. However, gluten in the diet can affect other health conditions like non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS).
Here's a complete guide to a gluten-free diet, including a simple sample menu. 
    </div>

            <div style="height: auto; width: 70%; padding: 18px; letter-spacing: 1.3px;">
            <h2>What is gluten?</h2>
            <h3>Keto basics</h3>
            <p>Gluten is a family of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and spelt.
 Its name comes from the Latin word for glue. It gives flour a sticky consistency when it’s mixed with water.
             This glue-like property helps gluten create a sticky network that gives bread the ability to rise when baked. It also gives bread a chewy and satisfying texture</p>
             The most common ways to test for celiac disease include:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Blood test:</strong> Blood tests are used to look for antibodies that incorrectly interact with the gluten protein. The most common test is the tissue transglutaminase IgA (tTG-IgA) test.</li>
<li><strong>Biopsy from your small intestine:</strong> People with a positive blood test will likely need to have a biopsy. During this process, a technician takes a small tissue sample from your intestine. The sample is then checked for damage</li>
</ul>
             
            <br>

            <strong>SUMMARY</strong><BR>
                Gluten is a family of proteins that‘s found in certain grains. Eating it causes harmful effects in people with celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). People with wheat allergy also need to avoid products containing any form of wheat.

            <h2>Why some people should avoid gluten</h2>
            Most people can eat gluten without experiencing any side effects, but people with celiac disease cannot tolerate it.
            People with other disorders like non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) and wheat allergy frequently avoid gluten too.
           <h3>Celiac disease</h3>n celiac disease, the body mistakes gluten for a foreign threat. To remove this perceived threat, the body overreacts and attacks the gluten proteins.
           People with celiac disease often experience symptoms such as:
           <ul>
            <li>diarrhea or constipation</li>
            <li>sharp stomach pain
            </li>
            <li>stomach discomfort</li>
            <li>bloating</li>
            <li>weight loss</li>
            <li>anemia</li>
        </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS)</h3>
            People diagnosed as having NCGS do not test positive for celiac disease or wheat allergy, but they still feel uncomfortable after eating gluten (10).

            Symptoms of NCGS are similar to those of celiac disease and can include: 
       <ul>
        <li>stomach pain</li>
        <li>changes in bowel movements</li>
        <li>tiredness</li>
        <li>skin rashes</li>
       </ul>
       

        <br>
        <h3>Wheat allergies</h3>Wheat allergy is a type of allergic reaction that occurs in response to one or more wheat proteins.
        It can cause symptoms like:
        <ul>
            <li>hives</li>
            <li>swelling or irritation of the mouth or throat</li>
            <li>nasal congestion</li>
            <li>difficulty breathing</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
            <strong>SUMMARY</strong><BR>
                Most people can tolerate gluten without any issues. However, people with celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), gluten ataxia, and wheat allergy may need to avoid foods containing gluten.

            <h2>Foods to avoid</h2>
            Completely avoiding gluten can be challenging, as it’s found in many common ingredients that are added to foods and beverages.
Wheat is the main source of gluten in the diet. Wheat-based products include:
<ul>
    <li>wheat bran</li>
    <li>wheat flour</li>
    <li>spelt</li>
    <li>durum</li>
    <li>kamut</li>
    <li>semolina</li>
</ul>          
Other gluten sources include:
<ul>
    <li>barley</li>
    <li>triticale, a hybrid crop that combines wheat and rye</li>
    <li>malt</li>
    <li>brewer’s yeast</li>
</ul>
Below are some items that may have gluten-containing ingredients added to them:
<ul type="disc">
            <li><strong>Bread:</strong> all wheat-based bread</li>
            <li><strong>Pasta: </strong>  all wheat-based pasta</li>
            <li><strong>Cereals: </strong> most types of cereal, unless they’re labeled gluten-free</li>
            <li><strong>Baked goods:</strong> andy, muesli bars, crackers, prepackaged convenience foods, roasted nuts, flavored chips, pretzels</li>
            <li><strong>Sauces: </strong> soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, hoisin sauce, marinades, salad dressings</li>
            <li><strong>Beverages: </strong>beer and some flavored alcoholic beverages</li>
            
            </ul> 
            <br>
            Many gluten-free products are now widely available, but it is important to read the ingredient section of the food label on most of the foods you buy.
            <br>
            <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
            <strong>SUMMARY</strong><BR>
            Avoid carb-based foods like grains, sugars, legumes, rice, potatoes, candy, juice, and even most fruits.
