        <h1>Ketogenic Diet</h1>
        <h2>The Ketogenic Diet: A Detailed Beginner's Guide to Keto</h2>
        <p>The ketogenic diet (or keto diet, for short) is a low carb, high fat diet that offers many health benefits.</p>
        <p>In fact, many studies show that this type of diet can help you lose weight and improve your health.</p>
        <p>Ketogenic diets may even have benefits against diabetes, cancer, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease.</p>
        <p>Here is a detailed beginner's guide to the keto diet.</p>
    </div>

            <div style="height: auto; width: 70%; padding: 18px; letter-spacing: 1.3px;">
            <h2>What is a ketogenic diet?</h2>
            <h3>Keto basics</h3>
            <p>The ketogenic diet is a very low carb, high fat diet that shares many similarities with the Atkins and low carb diets.</p>
            <p>It involves drastically reducing carbohydrate intake and replacing it with fat. This reduction in carbs puts your body into a metabolic state called ketosis.</p>
            <p>When this happens, your body becomes incredibly efficient at burning fat for energy. It also turns fat into ketones in the liver, which can supply energy for the brain.</p>
            <p>Ketogenic diets can cause significant reductions in blood sugar and insulin levels. This, along with the increased ketones, has some health benefits.</p>
            <br>

            <strong>SUMMARY</strong><BR>
            The keto diet is a low carb, high fat diet. It lowers blood sugar and insulin levels and shifts the body's metabolism away from carbs and toward fat and ketones.

            <h2>Different types of ketogenic diets</h2>
            <h3>There are several versions of the ketogenic diet, including:</h3>
            <ul type="disc">
            <li><strong>Standard ketogenic diet (SKD):</strong> This is a very low carb, moderate protein and high fat diet. It typically contains 70% fat, 20% protein, and only 10% carbs.</li>
            <li><strong>Cyclical ketogenic diet (CKD):</strong> This diet involves periods of higher carb refeeds, such as 5 ketogenic days followed by 2 high carb days.</li>
            <li><strong>Targeted ketogenic diet (TKD):</strong> This diet allows you to add carbs around workouts.</li>
            <li><strong>High protein ketogenic diet:</strong> This is similar to a standard ketogenic diet, but includes more protein. The ratio is often 60% fat, 35% protein, and 5% carbs.</li>
            </ul> 
            <br>
            <p>However, only the standard and high protein ketogenic diets have been studied extensively. Cyclical or targeted ketogenic diets are more advanced methods and primarily used by bodybuilders or athletes.</p>
            <p>The information in this article mostly applies to the standard ketogenic diet (SKD), although many of the same principles also apply to the other versions.</p>

            <h2>Other health benefits of keto</h2>
            <h3>The ketogenic diet actually originated as a tool for treating neurological diseases such as epilepsy.</h3>
            <h3>Studies have now shown that the diet can have benefits for a wide variety of different health conditions:</h3>
            <ul type="disc">
            <li><strong>Heart Disease.</strong> The ketogenic diet can help improve risk factors like body fat, HDL (good) cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and blood sugar.</li>
            <li><strong>Cancer.</strong> The diet is currently being explored as an additional treatment for cancer, because it may help slow tumor growth. </li>
            <li><strong>Alzheimer's disease.</strong> The keto diet may help reduce symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and slow its progression.</li>
            <li><strong>Epilepsy.</strong> Research has shown that the ketogenic diet can cause significant reductions in seizures in epileptic children.</li>
            <li><strong>Parkinson's disease. </strong> Although more research is needed, one study found that the diet helped improve symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</li>
            <li><strong>Polycystic ovary syndrome.</strong> The ketogenic diet can help reduce insulin levels, which may play a key role in polycystic ovary syndrome.</li>
            <li><strong>Brain injuries. </strong> Some research suggests that the diet could improve outcomes of traumatic brain injuries.</li>
            </ul> 
            <br>
            <p>However, keep in mind that research into many of these areas is far from conclusive.</p>

            <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
            <strong>SUMMARY</strong><BR>
            A ketogenic diet may provide many health benefits, especially with metabolic, neurological, or insulin-related diseases.
